Oracle Aggregator

Oracle Integration: Fetch price feeds from at least two different oracle providers.
Data Aggregation: Compute the average of the fetched price feeds. 
Frontend Display: Present the aggregated data on the UI.
Deployment: Ensure the application can be tested and deployed on Cloudflare or Vercel.

Design and develop an Oracle Aggregator for a DeFi application. The aggregator should pull price feeds from at least two different oracle sources, calculate an average, and display it on the frontend (FE). Note- for this bounty, you MUST use the new Pyth oracle model. 


Backend
- Should get current price and get average (average market price)
- summation of price of current asset/ number of oracle
- 120(pyth) + 121(switchboard)/ 2 (pyth + switchboard) example

Fe
- Search by address
- get result from backend
